### [week 1: Public Key Cryptography](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/public-private-keys/Public-Key-Cryptography-1)
-   ```js
    const bytesOne = new Uint8Array([2, 5, 6, 257]); // it takes less memory than the tradional array.
    ```
    ```js
    output: Uint8Array(4) [2, 5, 6, 1] // 257 is converted to 1 because it is 8-bit.
    ```
- `UInt8Array Enforces constraints` 
    - It makes sure every element doesnâ€™t exceed 255. 
    - If it does, it wraps around to 0. 
    - That is Modulo 256. 
    - That is why 257 becomes 1 (257 % 256 = 1).
